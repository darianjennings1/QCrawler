# Q-Learning based Reinforcement Learning for crash detection in mobile-applications 🐛

<h2> Purpose: </h2>
We propose a robust and fully automated structure that allows for a progressively more effective and accurate approach to testing and detecting faults in GUI for applications. The approach involves using a mobile-application crawler in tandem with a machine learning algorithm known as Q-learning in order to offer the best coverage-based testing that still uses random actions to pursue the best chances for finding faults in the GUI.

<h2> Tools Used 💡: </h2>
1. Python <br>
2. Appium & Selenium -- https://appium.io/ <br>
3. XML & SQLite
