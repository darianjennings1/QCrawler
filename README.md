# Q-Learning based Reinforcement Learning for fault detection in mobile-applications

<h2> Purpose: </h2>
We propose a robust and fully automated structure that allows for a progressively more effective and accurate approach to testing and detecting faults in GUI for applications. The approach involves using a mobile-application crawler in tandem with a machine learning algorithm known as Q-learning in order to offer the best coverage-based testing that still uses random actions to pursue the best chances for finding faults in the GUI.

<h2> Tools Utilized: </h2>
Python, Appium & Selenium, Android Studio, XML, JaCoCo, & SQLite 

<h2> Code Report: </h2>
This was completed as an undergraduate research project at The University of North Texas during the summer of 2020.
